## Motivation
The Singapore Book Council’s administrators face significant challenges in efficiently organising and scheduling meetings among multiple participants. By focusing on the core functionality of scheduling meetings, we prioritised solving a critical pain point that directly impacts productivity and time management.

This targeted approach ensures that administrators can seamlessly coordinate schedules, reduce time spent on logistical tasks, and dedicate more attention to their primary responsibilities. 

## Aim
Our solution is a smart meeting scheduler that simplifies the process of finding the best time for a meeting. By considering participants' availability, preferences, and existing commitments, our system automatically suggests optimal meeting slots. 

This ensures a hassle-free and efficient way to coordinate meetings, saving time and improving productivity.

## User Stories
As a user, I am able to schedule meetings by selecting participants, so that the system automatically checks their availability and adds the event to their Google Calendar. This eliminates the need for manual invitations and reduces the time spent coordinating schedules.

## Feature 1: User Authentication
The web app requires users to sign in through their Google accounts to ensure secure access and seamless functionality. This not only verifies user identity but also enables integration with the Google Calendar API, allowing the app to check availability, create events, and send invites directly to participants’ calendars.

Using Google Sign-In makes the onboarding process easier by eliminating the need for separate accounts, while also maintaining the necessary security.
